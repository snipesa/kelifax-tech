Documentation: Simplifying JSON and Integrating External API for Resource Details
Objective:
Simplify the resources.json file to include only the main values required for displaying resources in the "View Resources" section.
When a user clicks on a resource to view its details, trigger an external API call to fetch the additional data from DynamoDB via a Lambda function.
Steps to Implement:
1. Simplify resources.json:
Retain only the fields required for the "View Resources" section.
Remove detailed fields like keyFeatures, useCases, and learningResources from the JSON file.
Proposed fields to keep:
slug: Unique identifier for the resource.
title: Name of the resource.
description: Short description of the resource.
category: Category of the resource (e.g., development, design).
tags: Tags for filtering or searching.
url: Link to the resource.
featured: Boolean to indicate if the resource is featured.
image: Path to the resource's image.
2. Update the Frontend:
Use the simplified resources.json to display the list of resources in the "View Resources" section.
Each resource card should include:
Title
Short description
Image
Tags (optional) Allow tags as is as well as description
A "View Details" button or link.
3. Trigger External API for Resource Details:
When a user clicks on "View Details" for a resource:
Use the slug as the identifier to fetch detailed data from DynamoDB via a Lambda function.
The Lambda function will query DynamoDB for the resource details and return the full JSON object.

4. Lambda Function Implementation:
The Lambda function should:
Accept the slug as a query parameter.
Query DynamoDB for the resource details using the slug as the primary key.
Return the full resource details in JSON format.
Follow the coding standards:
Use Python for the Lambda function.
Fetch major parameters (e.g., table name) from AWS Parameter Store.
Use print for CloudWatch logging.
Handle errors gracefully with try-except blocks.
5. Update the Frontend to Display Details:
When the API response is received:
Populate the resource details page with the additional data.
Include fields like keyFeatures, useCases, and learningResources.

]

Example API Response for Resource Details:
When the user clicks on "View Details," the API will return the full resource details. Example response:

{
  "slug": "visual-studio-code",
  "title": "Visual Studio Code",
  "description": "Free, open-source code editor with intelligent code completion and debugging capabilities.",
  "category": "development",
  "tags": ["code editor", "microsoft", "extensions"],
  "url": "https://code.visualstudio.com",
  "featured": true,
  "image": "vscode.png",
  "keyFeatures": [
    {
      "title": "IntelliSense Code Completion",
      "description": "Smart code completion with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and intelligent suggestions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Built-in Git Integration",
      "description": "Native Git support with visual diff editor, staging, branching, and seamless version control workflow."
    }
  ],
  "useCases": [
    "Full-stack web development",
    "Mobile app development",
    "DevOps and infrastructure as code"
  ],
  "learningResources": [
    {
      "title": "VS Code Official Documentation",
      "url": "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs",
      "type": "Documentation"
    },
    {
      "title": "VS Code Tips and Tricks",
      "url": "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks",
      "type": "Guide"
    }
  ]
}

Also there will be no need for the .env value for Public_url=no
as using this , i want to make sure resources will always stay in this manner locally
and called the api when clicked on

Note the /admin shows only resources submitted and needs validation
This should be different from my regular get resources which i have explained above

Next Steps:
Simplify resources.json:

Update the file to match the proposed format.
Remove unnecessary fields.
Implement Lambda Function:

Create a Python Lambda function to fetch resource details from DynamoDB.
Use the slug as the primary key for querying.
Update Frontend:

Use the simplified resources.json for the "View Resources" section.
Add functionality to fetch and display detailed data when a user clicks "View Details."
Test the Integration:

Ensure the API call works correctly and the frontend displays the detailed data as expected.
Optimize Performance:

Use caching (e.g., CloudFront or DynamoDB Accelerator) to reduce latency for API calls.
